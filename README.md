Although this course was quite challenging, I did eventually render some interesting virtual scenes and explored the possibility of using animations in settings that have propelled my interest in digital graphics and design. 

When approaching the design of software, there are several steps that I follow to ensure a successful outcome: 

 I start by understanding the requirements and goals of the software that I am designing. This involves gathering information from stakeholders, conducting research, and analyzing user needs. 

Clearly define the scope of the software project, including its functionalities, constraints, and limitations. This helps you establish boundaries and set realistic expectations. 

Develop a high-level architectural design for the software. This includes deciding on the system's components, their interactions, and the overall structure. Consider factors such as modularity, scalability, and maintainability. 

Divide the software design process into smaller tasks and prioritize them based on dependencies and importance. This helps in managing the complexity of the project and facilitates collaboration if working with a team. 

Develop prototypes or mockups to visualize the user interface and test different design ideas. Prototyping and planning allow me to gather feedback early in the design process and make necessary improvements. 

 Adopt an iterative approach to design, where you continually refine and improve the software based on user feedback and testing. This involves cycles of design, implementation, testing, and evaluation. I found this to be an important aspect in the development of the project. The most difficult and time consuming, also. 

Document the design decisions, architecture, and important considerations throughout the design process. This documentation serves as a reference for future development, maintenance, and troubleshooting. 

 
I found that the development cycle of the various projects that I encountered during this course was easily simplified if I followed the steps that I have illustrated. The projects can be broken down into smaller chunks that can be worked on more easily and this philosophy can help in the successful completion of the projects. Computational graphics and visualizations allow me to view the projects in a different way that allows me to incorporate this knowledge that can be applied to build my future professional experience.
